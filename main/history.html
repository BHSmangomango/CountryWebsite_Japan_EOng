        <p>Under the Tokugawa shogunate, there was a period between 1603 and 1868 called the Edo period when hardly anyone was allowed to enter or leave the country, be it for travel or trade. Regulations were extremely strict, and naturally, trade and foreign relations with other countries became severely strained during this time, especially when it came to the West. </p>
