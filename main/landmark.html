      <p>This is Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, located at Kyoto. The green bamboo of Arashiyama, 
        swaying in a gentle breeze, is a hypnotic sight. No wonder this serene, shady forest, 
        one of the best places to visit in Japan, has captured the imagination of poets and artists for hundreds of years. 
        There’s almost perfect symmetry as you wander along the path, almost impossibly tall, slender bamboos arching gracefully overhead.</p>

      <p>Dōtonbori is the shopping district at the heart of modern Osaka. A sea of neon signage and modern buildings, its most famous sight is the giant running Glico Man breasting a tape.

This flashing neon logo for a food company has been a symbol of this Japanese city since the 1940s. It was the first large advert restored after the destruction of World War II.</p>
